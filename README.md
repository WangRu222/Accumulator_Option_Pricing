# The option
The “accumulator” or “accumulative forward” is a daily accumulated and knock-out structured
product linked to the performance of an underlying asset. It can be considered as a portfolio
of forward contracts with the “occupation time” feature. The accumulated amount of assets
depends on the total excursion time of the asset price below the strike price. This leads to an
enhanced downside loss. The upside gain is limited by the knock-out feature with an upside
barrier.

A typical equality-linked accumulator contract obligates an investor to buy a preset amount
of underlying stocks at the strike price X, if the closing stock price on a trading day is higher
than X. However, when the stock closes lower than X, the investor has to buy twice the
amount of stocks at X. Normally, the strike price X is set at a discount of the original spot
price S0. This explains why the accumulator is also called “discounted stock” among public.
On the other hand, the profit from an accumulator contract is capped by an knock-out barrier
H which is set higher than S0.
